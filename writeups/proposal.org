* Motivation
It is often asked what are the some of the most important applications of a
quantum computer. Embarrassingly, the answer is a short one. Currently, the only
quantum algorithm that provides exponential speed up comparing to the classical
counter-part is Shor's algorithm. Making things even worse, Shor's algorithm
does not solve any problem, it poses more problem in the sense that it will
destroy an encryption system that is working.

In response to this, we are looking for a new quantum algorithm that can solve
practically useful problems. Finding such an algorithm is not an easy task,
especially when we don't know what IS the difference between classical and
quantum computing. Therefore, we will have the motivation of understanding what
makes a quantum circuit hard to simulate. More specifically, we will have the
motivation of understanind it in the setting of fermionic quantum circuits.

* Goal
Implement algorithms for classically simulating fermoinic quantum circuits. This
could be done in many different ways, including but not limited to, using
ZW-Calculus, algorithms mentioned in paper.

* Time-line
